<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The asterisk (*) is a CSS selector that matches any element in an<br>HTML document. It selects any element that is a descendant of a &quot;nav&quot;<br>element when combined with the &quot;nav&quot; keyword, as in &quot;nav&quot;. So by doing<br>that I was able to target the navigation bar and then it was<br>just matter of applying normal CSS styling like display: inline ; that would<br>make it horizontal.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This CSS rule targets the second child of an ul (unorderd list) parent<br>element (ul:nth-child(2)). Now when I was able to target what I wanted I<br>just set CSS list-style property to none. That led me to successfully remove<br>those bullet points.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>As I mentioned earlier targeting navigation bar with nav * and after that<br>I can do whatever CSS styling I want to do with nav bar<br>so since I already did that before now I just had to apply<br>CSS property background-color to whatever color I desired and that gave me an<br>output of&nbsp;property setting the background color of an nav bar.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This was actually pretty easy stuff to do first I did&nbsp; a:hover which<br>is a selector that targets anchor elements (&lt;a&gt;) when the mouse hovers over<br>them. then again it was just applying basic CSS property like background-color to<br>whatever color I desired and when I would mouseover/hover on those anchor tags<br>it would highlight the color I set for hovering.&nbsp;<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (✓)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Here's the breakdown&nbsp;</div>Step 1 : ul:nth-child(2) selects the page's second ul element. The<br>CSS pseudo-class nth-child() selects elements based on their position in a parent container.&nbsp;<div>Step<br>2:&nbsp;li:before determines which pseudo-element appears before each li element.&nbsp;</div><div>Step 3: content:"\2714\0020";&nbsp; sets the<br>pseudo-content element's to the checkmark symbol.&nbsp; here you can directly set checkmark emoji<br>as well I believe that works fine as well.&nbsp;</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This was pretty easy thing to do I just targeted both of the<br>element together by doing h1, a {&nbsp;text-transform: capitalize; }&nbsp; so what I am<br>doing here is first getting both of those element h1 and a and<br>then again applying basic CSS&nbsp; Property text-transform: capitalize;&nbsp; which will capitalizes the first<br>letter of each word in the text and sets all other letters to<br>lowercase.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>So for the custom styling I didn&#39;t do much I just applied background-color<br>to entire page and added a little padding to navigation bar.&nbsp; I already<br>knew how to target the nav bar so now it was just matter<br>of applying padding to some px.&nbsp;By adding padding to a navbar, you can<br>create more space around the navbar links, logo, or other content inside the<br>navbar.<div><br></div><div>Secondly applying the background-color to entire page first I needed to target whole<br>page so I did that by doing html {} that targets entire page<br>and then again just applying CSS property background-color to whatever I wanted.&nbsp;</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>nth-child is the way to go if you don&#39;t want to contradict /<br>overlap one styling with others.&nbsp;<div><div>So, basically the CSS pseudo-class nth-child is used to<br>select elements based on their position within a parent container. Starting with the<br>first child element, you can target and style specific child elements based on<br>their index number. by doing this I was able to target my desired<br>thing which in this case was&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.09996px;">challenge list&nbsp; and make all sort<br>of styling and in the mean time avoided&nbsp;overlapping any of this styling to<br>navigation list.&nbsp;</span></div></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>word = anchor.textContent;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// setting my anchor.textContent to varrible word now I<br>know that in this case it will be basically Login, Register, Profile, and<br>Logout one by one since I put this in for loop&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;document.querySelector(&#39;h1&#39;).textContent = word;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;//&nbsp; It selects the first &quot;h1&quot; element in the HTML document and sets<br>its text content to the value of the &quot;word&quot; variable which for example<br>again let&#39;s say is Login and will be Logout after my last for<br>loop iteration.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Again basically same thing as previous question&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div>word = anchor.textContent;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// setting my<br>anchor.textContent to varrible word now I know that in this case it will<br>be basically Login, Register, Profile, and Logout one by one since I put<br>this in foreach loop&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;document.title= word;&nbsp; &nbsp;//&nbsp; Overall, this code block updates the text<br>content of the title of the HTML document to match the text content<br>of the "anchor" element. which we know can be only for things Login,<br>Register, Profile, Logout.&nbsp;</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>From this assignment I learned a lot about CSS basics&nbsp;<div><div><br></div><div>CSS basics&nbsp;</div><div>I learned about<br>how to target specific elements and apply your desired styling to those things<br>in the meantime how to avoid applying that style to everything else. I<br>also learned about different CSS properties like background-color&nbsp; how there so many colors<br>you can choose from and apply and how there are so many different<br>ways you can set it as well whether it be just writing the<br>simple color name, you can also do color code #code then there is<br>rgb() option as well which is very versatile thing in CSS I feel<br>like. Then there is display which you can use to set the nav<br>bar in way you desired and for this also you can do it<br>in so many ways. And all the other things that I learned which<br>was pretty cool from hover, padding, text-transform, list-style, and content etc.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I also learned<br>about how querySelectorAll() is a method in JavaScript that is used to select<br>and retrieve all the elements in a web page that match a specified<br>CSS selector. In our case I had to apply this to target those<br>anchor tags.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
